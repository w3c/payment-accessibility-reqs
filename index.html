    <p>This document presents the accessibility requirements users with disabilities have
    with respect to making payments on the web. </p>
    <p>It first provides an introduction to the needs of users with disabilities
    in relation to payments.</p>
    <p>Then it explains what accessibility enhancing technologies have been developed
    to help such users.</p>
    <p>A third section explains how these technologies fit in the larger
    picture of accessibility, both technically within a web user agent
    and from a production process point of view. </p>
    <p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline user agent
    requirements. It is important to recognize that not all
    user agents will support all the features discussed
    in this document. Rather, this document attempts to supply a comprehensive
    collection of user requirements needed to support payment accessibility in
    the context of HTML5. </p>
    <p>Please also note this document is not an inventory of technology currently
    provided by, or missing from HTML5 specification drafts. Technology is listed
    here because it's important for accommodating the alternative access
    needs of users with disabilities to web-based payments. This document is an
    inventory of Payment Accessibility User Requirements. </p>

    <h2>Summary of Accessible Payment Requirements by Type of Disability </h2>

    <p>This section provides examples of the accessibility
    requirements of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological,
    physical, speech, or visual disabilities to access and
    comprehend media, including requirements for media formats and
    media player technologies. For a broader exploration of how
    people with different disabilities interact with web content and
    tools, see <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html">How
        People with Disabilities Use the Web</a>.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Blindness </h3>
        <p rel="bibo:issue" typeof="bibo:Issue"><span
            resource="http://www.w3.org/2014/11/17-html-a11y-media-minutes.html" 
            rel="bibo:affirmedBy">People who are blind cannot access visual information in
            videos, player controls, status indicators, etc. They need
            the information in an alternative representation of audio or
            text. People who are blind use a screen reader and/or
            refreshable Braille display, and media content needs to be
            operable with these assistive technologies (<abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr>).</span></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Low vision </h3>
        <p>People with low vision can use some visual information.
        Depending on their visual
        ability they might have specific issues such as difficulty discriminating
        foreground information from background information, or discriminating colors.
        Glare caused by excessive scattering in the eye can be a significant challenge,
        especially for very bright content or surroundings. They may be unable
        to react quickly to transient information, and may have a narrow angle
        of view and so may not detect key information presented temporarily where
        they are not looking, or in text that is moving or scrolling. A person
        will likely use screen magnification software.  This means that they will only be viewing
        a portion of the screen, and so must manage tracking media content via
        their AT. They may have difficulty reading when text is too small, has
        poor background contrast (too high or too low), or when outlined or other fancy font types or
        effects are used. If the font is an image, it is likely to appear grainy when magnified.
        They may be using an AT that adjusts all the colors of
        the screen, such as inverting the colors, so the media content must be
        viewable through the AT. Users with low vision will often benefit from the same 
        text streams and instructions that are sometimes hidden or displayed off screen for 
        users of screen readers or refreshable Braille. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Atypical color perception </h3>
        <p>People with atypical color perception (often called
        "color blindness") may not be able to 
        discriminate between different colors, or may miss
        key information when coded with color only, such as colors in media
        controls and text overlays.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Auditory: Deafness </h3>
        <p>People who are deaf generally cannot use audio. Thus, an alternative representation
        is required, typically through synchronized captions and/or sign translation. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Auditory: Hard of hearing </h3>
        <p>People who are hard of hearing may be able to use some audio material,
        but might not be able to discriminate certain types of sound, and may miss
        any information presented as audio only if it contains frequencies they
        can't hear, or is masked by background noise or distortion. They may miss
        audio which is too quiet, or of poor quality. Speech may be challenging
        if it is too fast and cannot be played back more slowly. Information presented
        using multichannel audio (e.g., stereo) may not be perceived by people
        who are deaf in one ear.
        People with cochlear implants may not
        have issues with audio volume levels, but comprehension may be
        challenging if the media experience is overwhelming.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Auditory &amp; Visual: Deaf-blind </h3>
        <p>Individuals who are deaf-blind have a combination of conditions that may
        result in one of the following: blindness and deafness; blindness and difficulty
        in hearing; low vision and deafness; or low vision and difficulty in hearing.
        Depending on their combination of conditions, individuals who are deaf-blind
        may need captions that can be enlarged, changed to high-contrast colors,
        or otherwise styled; or they may need captions and/or described video that
        can be presented with AT (e.g., a refreshable Braille display). They may
        need synchronized captions and/or described video, or they may need a non-time-based
        transcript which they can read at their own pace. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Physical impairment </h3>
        <p>Some people with physical disabilities such as limited
        muscle control (including tremors, lack of coordination, and
        paralysis), pain that impedes movement, or missing limbs
        cannot use a keyboard or mouse to interact with content and
        controls. Some use a keyboard but not a pointing device,
        some use a switch with an on-screen keyboard, and some use
        other assistive technology. The media player must be usable
        with only a keyboard, including access to all player
        controls and methods for selecting alternative content.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Cognitive disabilities </h3>
        <p>Cognitive disabilities include a wide range of conditions
        that may include intellectual disabilities (called learning disabilities
        in some regions), autism-spectrum disorders, memory impairments, mental-health
        disabilities, attention-deficit disorders, audio- and/or visual-perceptive
        disorders, dyslexia and dyscalculia (called learning disabilities in some
        regions), or seizure disorders. The accessibility supports for these different
        conditions vary widely.
        Individuals with some conditions may process
        information aurally better than by reading text; therefore, information
        that is presented as text embedded in a video should also be available
        as audio descriptions. Individuals with other conditions may need to reduce
        distractions or flashing in presentations of video. Some conditions, such
        as autism-spectrum disorders, may have multisystem effects. Individuals
        may need a combination of different accommodations.
        Overall, the media experience for people on the autism spectrum should
        be customizable and well designed so as to not be overwhelming. Care
        must be taken to present a media experience that focuses on the purpose
        of the content and provides alternative content in a clear, concise manner. </p>
    </section>

<section>
    <h2>Alternative Content Technologies </h2>
    <p>A number of alternative content types have been developed to help users
    with sensory disabilities gain access to textual web content. This section
    lists them, explains generally what they are, and provides a number of requirements
    on each that need to be satisfied with technology developed in / supported by HTML5.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2> System Requirements </h2>
    <section>
        <h3> Access to interactive controls / menus </h3>
        <p>Media elements offer a rich set of interaction possibilities to users.
        These interaction possibilities must be available to all users, including
        those that cannot use a pointer device for interaction. Further, these
        interaction possibilities must be available to all users for all means
        in which the controls are exposed - no matter whether they are exposed
        by the user agent, or are scripted. Further, the interaction possibilities
        need to be rich enough to allow all users fine grained control over media
        playback. </p>
        <p>It is imperative that controls be device independent, so that control
        may be achieved by keyboard, pointing device, speech, etc. </p>
        <p>Systems supporting accessibility for interactive controls must: </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-1"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-1]</strong> Support operation of all functionality via
                the keyboard on systems where a keyboard is (or can be) present, and
                where focusable elements
                are used for interaction. This does not forbid and should not discourage
                providing pointing device
                or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
            </div>
            <p class="note">This means that all interaction possibilities with media elements
            need to be keyboard accessible; e.g., through being able to tab onto
            the play, pause, mute buttons, and to move the playback position from
            the keyboard. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-3"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-3]</strong> All functionality available to native controls
                must also be available to scripted controls. The author would be able
                to choose any/all of the controls, style them and position them. </div>
            <p class="note">This means that new IDL attributes need to be added to the media
            elements for the extra controls that are accessibility related. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-5"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-5]</strong> The scripted and native controls must go
                through the same platform-level accessibility framework (where it exists),
                so that a user presented with the scripted version is not
                excluded from participating in or experiencing 
                some expected behavior. </div>
            <p class="note">This is below the level of HTML and means that the accessibility
            platform needs to be extended to allow access to these controls. </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Requirements on making properties available to the accessibility interface </h3>
        <p>Often forgotten in media systems, especially with the newer forms of packaging
        such as DVD menus and on-screen program guides, is the fact that the user
        needs to actually get to the content, control its playback, and turn on
        any required accessibility options. For user agents supporting accessibility
        APIs implemented for a platform, any media controls need to be connected
        to that API. </p>
        <p>On self-contained products that do not support assistive technology, any
        menus in the content need to provide information in alternative formats
        (e.g., talking menus). Products with a separate remote control, or that
        are self-contained boxes, should ensure the physical design does not block
        access, and should make accessibility controls, such as the closed-caption
        toggle, as prominent as the volume or channel controls. </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="API-1"><strong class="req-handle">[API-1]</strong> The existence of alternative-content tracks for a media
                resource must be exposed to the user agent. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="API-2"><strong class="req-handle">[API-2]</strong> Since authors will need access to the alternative content
                tracks, the structure needs to be exposed to authors as well, which
                requires a dynamic interface. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="API-3"><strong class="req-handle">[API-3]</strong> Accessibility APIs need to gain access to alternative content
                tracks no matter whether those content tracks come from within a resource
                or are combined through markup on the page. </div>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Requirements on the use of the viewport </h3>
        <p>The video viewport plays a particularly important role with respect to
        alternative-content technologies. Mostly it provides a bounding box for
        many of the visually represented alternative-content technologies (e.g.,
        captions, hierarchical navigation points, sign language), although some
        alternative content does not rely on a viewport (e.g., full transcripts,
        descriptive video). </p>
        <p>One key principle to remember when designing player ‘skins’ is that the
        lower-third of the video may be needed for caption text. Caption consumers
        rely on being able to make fast eye movements between the captions and
        the video content. If the captions are in a non-standard place, this may
        cause viewers to miss information. The use of this area for things such
        as transport controls, while appealing aesthetically, may lead to accessibility
        conflicts. </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="VP-1"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-1]</strong> It must be possible to deal with three different
                cases for the relation between the viewport size, the position of media
                and of alternative content:</div>
            <ol class="list-in-req">
                <li>the alternative content's extent is specified in relation
                to the media viewport (e.g., picture-in-picture video, lower-third
                captions) </li>
                <li>the alternative content has its own independent extent,
                but is positioned in relation to the media viewport (e.g., captions
                above the audio, sign-language video above the audio, navigation
                points below the controls) </li>
                <li>the alternative content has its own independent extent and
                doesn't need to be rendered in any relation to the media viewport
                (e.g., text transcripts) </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If alternative content has a different height or width than the media
            content, then the user agent will reflow the (HTML) viewport.  </p>
            <p class="note">This may create a need to provide an author hint to the web page
            when embedding alternative content in order to instruct the web page how
            to render the content: to scale with the media resource, scale independently,
            or provide a position hint in relation to the media. On small devices
            where the video takes up the full viewport, only limited rendering choices
            may be possible, such that the UA may need to override author preferences. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="VP-2"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-2]</strong> The user can change the following characteristics
                of visually rendered text content, overriding those specified by the
                author or user-agent defaults  (Note: this should
                include captions and any text rendered in relation to media elements,
                so as to be able to magnify and simplify rendered text):</div>
            <ol class="list-in-req">
                <li>text scale (i.e., the general size of text), </li>
                <li>font family</li>
                <li>text color (i.e., foreground and background) </li>
                <li>letter spacing (tracking and kerning)</li>
                <li>line spacing (or line height), and</li>
                <li>word spacing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">This should be achievable through UA configuration or user defined javascript or CSS which can override styles dynamically in the browser. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="VP-3"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-3]</strong> Provide the user with the ability to adjust
                the size of the time-based media up to the full height or width of
                the containing viewport, with the ability to preserve aspect ratio
                and to adjust the size of the playback viewport to avoid cropping,
                within the scaling limitations imposed by the media itself.  </div>
            <p class="note">This can be achieved by simply zooming into the web page, which
            will automatically rescale the layout and reflow the content. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="VP-4"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-4]</strong> Provide the user with the ability to control
                the contrast and brightness of the content within the playback viewport.
            </div>
            <p class="note">This is a user-agent device requirement and should already be
            addressed in the UAAG. In live content, it may even be possible to adjust
            camera settings to achieve this requirement. It is also a   &quot;SHOULD&quot; level
            requirement, since it does not account for limitations of various devices. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="VP-5"><strong class="req-handle">[VP-5]</strong> Captions and subtitles traditionally occupy
                the lower third of the video, where controls are also usually
                rendered. The user agent must avoid overlapping of overlay content
                and controls on media resources. This must also happen if, for example,
                the controls are only visible on demand. </div>
            <p class="note">If there are several types of overlapping overlays (including 
            captions and subtitles), implementations should attempt to ensure that none of
            them overlaps with editorially important content.
            In
            particular, user agents
            should avoid obscuring video components such as mouths, "burned in text" (embedded
            captions or other annotations in the main video stream), etc.  When in
            constrained environments where it is impossible to avoid obscuring all of these
            components, user agents should make every effort to avoid the most important of
            them.  Users typically expect

        <h3>Requirements on secondary screens and other devices</h3>
        <p>Multiple secondary user devices must be directly addressable. This
        functionality is increasingly also known  by the new term, &quot;Second Screen,&quot;
        even though there may be more than two screens in any given viewing
        environment, and even though not all secondary devices are video displays. It
        must be assumed that many users will have at least one additional display
        device (such as a tablet), and/or at least one additional audio output device
        (such as a Bluetooth headset) attached to a primary video display device, an
        individual computer, or locally addressable on a LAN. It
        must be possible to configure certain types of media for presentation on
        specific devices, and these configuration settings must be readily overwritable
        on a case-by-case basis by users. </p>
