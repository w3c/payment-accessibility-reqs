    <p>This document presents the accessibility requirements users with disabilities have
    with respect to making payments on the web. </p>
    <p>It first provides an introduction to the needs of users with disabilities
    in relation to payments.</p>
    <p>Then it explains what accessibility enhancing technologies have been developed
    to help such users.</p>
    <p>A third section explains how these technologies fit in the larger
    picture of accessibility, both technically within a web user agent
    and from a production process point of view. </p>
    <p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline user agent
    requirements. It is important to recognize that not all
    user agents will support all the features discussed
    in this document. Rather, this document attempts to supply a comprehensive
    collection of user requirements needed to support payment accessibility in
    the context of HTML5. </p>
    <p>Please also note this document is not an inventory of technology currently
    provided by, or missing from HTML5 specification drafts. Technology is listed
    here because it's important for accommodating the alternative access
    needs of users with disabilities to web-based payments. This document is an
    inventory of Payment Accessibility User Requirements. </p>

    <h2>Summary of Accessible Payment Requirements by Type of Disability </h2>

    <p>This section provides examples of the accessibility
    requirements of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological,
    physical, speech, or visual disabilities to access and
    comprehend web content.
    For a broader exploration of how
    people with different disabilities interact with web content and
    tools, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html">How
    People with Disabilities Use the Web</a>.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Blindness </h3>
        <p> People who are blind cannot access visual information in
            prompts, selectors, status indicators, etc. They need
            the information in an alternative representation of audio or
            text. People who are blind use a screen reader and/or
            refreshable Braille display, and content needs to be
            operable with these assistive technologies (<abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr>).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Low vision </h3>
        <p>People with low vision can use some visual information.
        Depending on their visual
        ability they might have specific issues such as difficulty discriminating
        foreground information from background information, or discriminating colors.
        Glare caused by excessive scattering in the eye can be a significant challenge,
        especially for very bright content or surroundings. They may be unable
        to react quickly to transient information, and may have a narrow angle
        of view and so may not detect key information presented temporarily where
        they are not looking, or in text that is moving or scrolling. A person
        will likely use screen magnification software.  This means that they will only be viewing
        a portion of the screen, and so must manage content (e.g., pop-up windows
        or dynamic prompts) via
        their AT. They may have difficulty reading when text is too small, has
        poor background contrast (too high or too low), or when outlined or other fancy font types or
        effects are used. If the font is an image, it is likely to appear grainy when magnified.
        They may be using an AT that adjusts all the colors of
        the screen, such as inverting the colors, so the content must be
        viewable through the AT. Users with low vision will often benefit from the same 
        augmented content or instructions that are sometimes hidden or displayed off screen for 
        users of screen readers or refreshable Braille. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Visual: Atypical color perception </h3>
        <p>People with atypical color perception (often called
        "color blindness") may not be able to 
        discriminate between different colors, or may miss
        key information when coded with color only, such as colors in selection
        boxes or prompts embedded in input fields.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Auditory &amp; Visual: Deaf-blind </h3>
        <p>Individuals who are deaf-blind have a combination of conditions that may
        result in one of the following: blindness and deafness; blindness and difficulty
        in hearing; low vision and deafness; or low vision and difficulty in hearing.
        Depending on their combination of conditions, individuals who are deaf-blind
        may need text that can be enlarged, changed to high-contrast colors,
        or otherwise styled; or they may need text that
        can be presented with AT (e.g., a refreshable Braille display). </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Physical impairment </h3>
        <p>Some people with physical disabilities such as limited
        muscle control (including tremors, lack of coordination, and
        paralysis), pain that impedes movement, or missing limbs,
        cannot use a keyboard or mouse to interact with content and
        controls. Some use a keyboard but not a pointing device,
        some use a switch with an on-screen keyboard, and some use
        other assistive technology. The content must be usable
        with only a keyboard, including making selections of items that might have
        otherwise been done with a pointing device.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Cognitive disabilities </h3>
        <p>Cognitive disabilities include a wide range of conditions
        that may include intellectual disabilities (called learning disabilities
        in some regions), autism-spectrum disorders, memory impairments, mental-health
        disabilities, attention-deficit disorders, audio- and/or visual-perceptive
        disorders, dyslexia and dyscalculia (called learning disabilities in some
        regions), or seizure disorders. The accessibility supports for these different
        conditions vary widely.
        Individuals with some conditions may process
        information aurally better than by reading text; therefore, information
        that is presented as images (e.g., a so-called <em>captcha</em> image)
        should also be available
        as audio descriptions. Individuals with other conditions may need to reduce
        distractions or flashing. Some conditions, such
        as autism-spectrum disorders, may have multisystem effects. Individuals
        may need a combination of different accommodations.
        Overall, the user experience for people on the autism spectrum should
        be customizable and well designed so as to not be overwhelming. Care
        must be taken to present an experience that focuses on the purpose
        of the content and provides alternative content in a clear, concise manner. </p>

<section id="S_alternative_technologies">
    <h2>Alternative Content Technologies </h2>
    <p>A number of alternative content types have been developed to help users
    with sensory disabilities gain access to textual web content. This section
    lists them, explains generally what they are, and provides a number of requirements
    on each that need to be satisfied with technology developed in / supported by HTML5.</p>

    <h2> System Requirements </h2>
    <section>
        <h3> Access to interactive controls / menus </h3>
        <p>Payment interfaces offer a rich set of interaction possibilities to users.
        These interaction possibilities must be available to all users, including
        those that cannot use a pointer device for interaction. Further, these
        interaction possibilities must be available to all users for all means
        in which the controls are exposed - no matter whether they are exposed
        by the user agent, or are scripted. Further, the interaction possibilities
        need to be rich enough to allow all users complete access to the
        payment interface.</p>
        <p>It is imperative that controls be device independent, so that control
        may be achieved by keyboard, pointing device, speech, etc. </p>
        <p>Systems supporting accessibility for interactive controls must: </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-1"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-1]</strong> Support operation of all functionality via
                the keyboard on systems where a keyboard is (or can be) present, and
                where focusable elements
                are used for interaction. This does not forbid and should not discourage
                a providing pointing device
                or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
            </div>
            <p class="note">This means that all interaction possibilities with
            payment interaces
            need to be keyboard accessible; e.g., through being able to tab onto
            the various fields, select among payment methods, authenticate, etc.
            via the keyboard. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-2"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-2]</strong> All functionality available to native controls
                must also be available to scripted controls. The author would be able
                to choose any/all of the controls, style them and position them. </div>
            <p class="note">This may mean that user agents need to expose the UI
            aspects of embedded payment controls so that they can be adequately
            scripted and controlled.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="IC-3"><strong class="req-handle">[IC-3]</strong> The scripted and native controls must go
                through the same platform-level accessibility framework (where it exists),
                so that a user presented with the scripted version is not
                excluded from participating in or experiencing 
                some expected behavior. </div>
            <p class="note">This is below the level of HTML and means that the accessibility
            platform needs to be extended to allow access to these controls. </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Requirements on making properties available to the accessibility interface </h3>
        <p>On self-contained products that do not support assistive technology
        (e.g., a kiosk on a train platform), any
        menus in the content need to provide information in alternative formats
        (e.g., talking menus). Products with an external control, or that
        are self-contained boxes, should ensure the physical design does not block
        access, and should make accessibility controls, such as the closed-caption
        toggle, as prominent as the other controls. </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class='requirement' id="API-1"><strong
                    class="req-handle">[API-1]</strong> Since authors will need
                access to any alternative content
                made available by the payment system to the end user, the structure needs to be exposed to authors as well, which
                requires a dynamic interface. </div>
            <div class='requirement' id="API-2"><strong class="req-handle">[API-2]</strong> Accessibility APIs need to gain access to alternative content
                no matter whether that content comes from within a resource
                or are combined through markup on the page. </div>
